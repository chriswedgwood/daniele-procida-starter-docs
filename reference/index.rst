Technical reference
===================

..  important::

    This reference is mainly concerned with the way RST/Sphinx tools are used in *this* project,
    and does not aim to provide a formal reference for the entire system. However links are
    provided at the end of each page to more complete reference material in the official
    documentation.

    As far as using this starter kit however, the material contained here should suffice to be
    useful.
