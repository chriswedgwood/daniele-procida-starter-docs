Many software project maintainers struggle to:

* get started with documentation
* structure it
* set up its build tooling
* publish it
* maintain it

The `Documentation Starter Kit <https://divio.com>`_ aims to solve all those
problems. It's a set of files to help software documentation authors make a
quick start, with a clean, well-structured project.

The project includes tooling to set itself up, and build the documentation,
publishing it as a self-contained HTML website.

It's easy to use as the basis for your own, real documentation, and is ready to
be published on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_ - `just like the kit itself <https://readthedocs.org>`_

The kit contains all its own documentation. See the tutorial to get started.
