:orphan:

    This page is an *orphan*. It's not visible in any table of contents, but
    can be accessed at ``to-do.html``. ``:orphan:`` at the top of the file
    prevents a warning about the orphaned file being raised.

To do

Any to-do items in the documentation will appear here automatically, with links
back to the *original entry* in its own context.

..  warning::

    An issue in Sphinx Autobuild means that this only happens the first time
    the documentation is built. You'll need to run :ref:`delete the build
    directory <make-clean>`, forcing it to be rebuilt completely, to see new
    to-do items here.
