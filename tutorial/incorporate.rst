.. _tutorial-incorporate:

================================================
Incorporate the documentation into your codebase
================================================

..  warning::

    This section is incomplete.


**This is an optional step.** Your documentation can either exist as a
standalone project of its own (if for example it documents a platform or a
system of other components, or documents something other than code) or will be
part of the codebase of a project, as documentation alongside the code.

If your documentation will stand alone, then you can skip this section.
Otherwise:


Copy the documentation project into the repository
==================================================

Copy the entire documentation to the project's root, and rename it to something
like ``docs`` or ``documentation``.

You can leave the ``.gitignore`` file where it is.
