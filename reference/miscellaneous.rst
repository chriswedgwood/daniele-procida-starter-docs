To-do items
===========

To-do items and lists can optionally be enabled in the :ref:`conf.py file <conf.py>`.

``todo_include_todos``
    If ``True``, to-do items will be included in the published documentation (otherwise they'll
    only appear in the source).
``todo_link_only``
    If ``True``, to-do items in any :ref:`to-do list <to-do-list>` will be accompanied only by a
    link to the original entry; if True, the file and line number will also be mentioned.
``todo_emit_warnings``
    When ``True``, warnings will be generated when building the documentation.


..  todo::

    This is an example to-do item.

    It will also appear in the project's :ref:`to-do list <to-do-list>`.
